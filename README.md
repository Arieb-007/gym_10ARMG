# gym_10ARMG
This is question 2 of assignment 1 of CS698R course of IIT kanpur. </br>
In OpenAI Gym create the environment for 10-armed Gaussian Bandit. Make sure it is executing
as expected by creating certain test cases, e.g., by playing with Ïƒ. Report about your test cases and how
they point towards the correct implementation. You can also report about your general observations.
